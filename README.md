## So Long

> **This project consists of building a small top down game, where you have to collect all pearls to escape**
*(only available on Linux)*

The primary aspect of the program involves communication with MLX and X11, as well as parsing and error handling

*It is developed with miniLibX, the graphic library of 42 school*


## How to play
You need to compile all source files with  *`make all`*

To launch the game, execute **./so_long** with a map as argument:

    ./so_long maps/map.ber

    ./so_long maps/map2.ber

## MiniLibX


For more informations on the library go to [42Docs](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx)
